#This is my Day-6 of revision in basics of Python for PhiCoders. 
#Today i will go with for loop.

# #For Loop
# name = "Bonika"
# for i in name:
#     print(i, end=',') 

# colors = {"Red", "White", "Green", "Blue"}
# for i in colors:
#     print(i, end = ',') 

# for n in range(20):
#     print(n+1)

# for i in range(10,20):
#     print(i)

# for k in range(1, 20, 2):
#     print(k)

i = 0
while(i>5):
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
