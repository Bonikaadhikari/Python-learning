print("Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\n \nThen took the other, as just as fair, \nAnd having perhaps the better claim, \nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear; \nThough as for that the passing there \nHad worn them really about the same, \n")
